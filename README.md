## LektaAI Slack bot
Simple Slack bot integrated with Lekta Sandwich API.  

#### How to run
```angular2html
-> create virtaul env using your favourite tool (pyenv, virtualenv, etc.)

pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

If you are running this project locally, you'll need to set up tunnels for Slack to connect to your endpoints.
In this case I advice you to use Ngrok.
More precise information to how to set up bot properly can be found here: [Slack-Python-Onboarding-Tutorial](https://github.com/slackapi/Slack-Python-Onboarding-Tutorial)

Bot was created with help of tutorials from: [Slack API docs](https://api.slack.com/tutorials/tags/python).
